**Welcome to Seriuxmod Minecraft Java Client!**

🚀 **About Us**

Seriuxmod was founded in 2019 by Hostiliuus and NightSucht with the vision of enhancing the Minecraft gaming experience by introducing unique features not seen before in Minecraft.

🔍 **Our Journey**

We've had several attempts at implementation, facing setbacks due to execution challenges or lack of knowledge. However, both founders continue to represent the project to this day.

🛠️ **Project Components**

Seriuxmod currently comprises the Minecraft client, dedicated launcher, website, Discord bot, and a robust backend infrastructure equipped with load balancing and scaling capabilities to meet player demands.

🌐 **Community Engagement**

We promote our project through our community Discord server, where regular events will commence from mid-2024. In 2023, we joined forces with friends to establish a playable Minecraft network showcasing all client features. You can also test these features by integrating our API into your own Minecraft server, soon to be available in our Development Center on the website.

🤝 **Joining the Team**

Applications for positions within our team are exclusively accepted through our website's application portal.

🐞 **Reporting Bugs**

Please report bugs as issues on our GitHub. Individuals whose reported bugs are acknowledged and recognized will be rewarded with coins for our online shop.

Thank you for being a part of the Seriuxmod community! 🎉
